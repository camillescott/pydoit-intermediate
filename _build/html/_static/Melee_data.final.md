title: Agent Performance Similarity in a Bounded Sakurai Space
...

The bounded Sakurai Space is a two-dimensional platform-based
environment populated by particularly whimsical mathematical agents.
These agents compete with each other through a variety of very sciency
mechanisms, most of which are outside the bounds of this one-paragraph
publication. The reader should focus their attention on the chart, which
features a lovely dendrogram and some truly astonishing colors.
